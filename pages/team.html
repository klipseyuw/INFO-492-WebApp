                                <p>I'm not a particularly heavy user of AI. At most, I use it to check my work or to find niche subjects that Google can't find for me. Although I don't heavily use AI, I have used it significantly for work or research to understand its impact and capabilities.</p>

                                <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Project Influence</h4>
                                <p>This influences me to view this project from a curious perspective since AI in cybersecurity isn't directly used by typical users like ChatGPT or Copilot, but is instead globally implemented into technology users might access. I see the value of AI and agents in cybersecurity, especially in logistics, but I still raise an eyebrow on its effectiveness and stability for defense due to the non-deterministic nature of AI.</p>

                                <p>If the logistics industry gets attacked, I am certain that I will feel it in some capacity. For example, if I order something online and suddenly never receive the product due to an attack that reroutes packages being delivered, I would immediately see an impact in my life. On the other hand, if a shipping route is affected and materials or products being sent to a facility are displaced, I might not know immediately, but costs or the economy can shift, creating a less noticeable but impactful change in how I use my money.</p>

                                <p>I consider myself a moderate enthusiast of daily AI usage. While I don't fully grasp how LLMs and AI backends operate, I routinely employ various AI agents to assist with tasks and answer questions. If browsers like Google and Baidu were once my primary life/work assistants, AI has now become an even more indispensable presence.</p>

                                <p>Since our focus is the logistics industry—an area where AI can assist but not replace human labor due to its intricate details, collaborative nature, and unpredictable scenarios—this data-intensive sector faces exceptionally high vulnerability. I believe exploring the logistics industry's cybersecurity challenges and risks is crucial. One key insight this project could uncover is how to strategically leverage AI to boost efficiency while maintaining robust system security.</p>

                                <p>As an avid online shopper who frequently relies on international logistics services like FedEx and DHL to ship packages from China to the United States, any errors in the logistics process, system vulnerabilities, or theft of logistics privacy information would cause constant disruption to my life. This ranges from dealing with lost items to enduring long-term information harassment from third-party hackers as a user. There's no doubt that if this industry comes under attack, I will feel the impact significantly.</p>

                                <p>I also consider myself a moderate user of AI. My primary use case has been leveraging AI to help correct and improve code, which makes me fairly comfortable with applying AI tools in technical problem-solving. I'm familiar with different models such as GPT, Claude, and Gemini, which has given me a sense of the strengths and limitations of each.</p>

                                <p>Because of this background, I approach this project with a practical mindset: I can see how AI can be a powerful tool for improving efficiency and accuracy, but I also recognize that its outputs aren't always reliable without human oversight. In the context of logistics cybersecurity, this makes me particularly aware of the risks of depending too heavily on AI without safeguards, since even small errors or manipulated outputs in a high-stakes system could cause large-scale disruptions.</p>

                                <p>If the logistics industry were attacked, I would most likely feel it first through disruptions in my customer experience. For example, if I ordered an Amazon package and it never arrived—or the tracking system showed inaccurate or conflicting updates—that would be a clear signal of breakdown in the logistics network. Even short-term attacks could cause delays, rerouted shipments, or lost items, all of which would erode trust in the service. I get frustrated when packages aren't in the correct place due to human error, but if it's because of system compromise, it would definitely affect my customer experience.</p>
